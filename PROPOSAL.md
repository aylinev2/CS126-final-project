# Project Proposal

## Project Idea
For this project, I am going to create a [flappy bird](http://flappybird.io/)-like game. To create this game I will be using the ofxGui library since the game will require User Interfaces and will have music playing in the background. 

## Description
When the program is run, a window with the game start menu is going to pop up, music will begin to play, and the game will begin when the player presses a certain key to start. The user is able to play the game by pressing specified keys to jump up and get past the barriers. When the game starts, the score will be updated and displayed until the player loses and the player will also have the option to pause the game at any point. After losing, the player will then have the option to restart and the top ten scores will be displayed. 

## Libraries
* [ofxGui](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxGui/) - for creating graphical user interfaces
